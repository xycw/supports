<p>Dear sir/madam,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to cause you into trouble, I will explain the additional charge to you.</p>
<p>This part of charge is normal and can not be avoided. Because the margin fees is received by Bank .Below is the three reasons for this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, it will take the Cross-border royalties between Credit card issuing organization and Bank .</li>
<li>Secondly, the floating of exchange rate.</li>
<li>Finally, the currency exchange.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the above three factors resulted in a little bit difference between your consumption and the actual charge.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions please contact me directly.</p>
<p>Thank you and best regards!</p>
